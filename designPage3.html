                My goal for this second submission was to improve upon 
                my first submission. This proved to be extremely difficult 
                because I didn’t know how to fix what I had. This is 
                partly because my css was a mess of things that override 
                other things and lines that simply have no effect on the 
                site. If I changed one thing, a different section of the 
                page would break and break hard.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                So, I decided to just restart. This didn’t help much either 
                as I didn’t have a direction to go in. I was trying to 
                work and write code without knowing what my goal is. It was
                a mess. This isn’t even the first new version since my first 
                submission. It’s probably number 2 or 3.

                Things became a lot easier when I found an inspiration website. 
                I remembered one day that I really like car manufacturer 
                websites. They’re always so neat and amazing at the same time. 
                So I looked at <a href="https://www.bmw.co.za/en/index.html">https://www.bmw.co.za/en/index.html</a>  
                for inspiration.With this new direction I was able to get going. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Once I had the basic structure of the website down, I realised 
                that I hadn’t thought of any colours. The BMW website only uses 
                white, and then whatever colours are in their background images. 
                I tried to find some good background images but failed to find 
                something that would work. It’s either the colour of the background 
                made choosing a font colour awkward, or the background just didn’t 
                look great. If only I could just use the background images that BMW 
                was using. I mean I like cars. I could have made it make sense. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                . I decided against that though because I don’t know how the copyright 
                for background images work. I ended up using a grey background to keep 
                the site from being too bright and because I thought 2 colours would 
                be too little. I really need to learn more about colour combinations 
                and such. Whenever I tried to think of some colours to use other than 
                black and white, I drew a blank

            <p class="paragraph">
                The next set of issues I had were technical issues. CSS is quite terrible. 
                Designing responsively is tough if you started by designing for the big 
                screen. When you get to mobile device size your website starts to get jiggy 
                with itself. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Including Javascript was also tough because I’ve never used it before, and 
                I felt done when my structure was done so I didn’t know where to put it. 
                I ended up using it for a few small things. I just hope I’ll be able to 
                find some more interesting ways to use Javascript in future iterations.
